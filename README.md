Clemson ORAN Research

This repository contains various ORAN research efforts performed at Clemson University. A full list of tutorials and open source code references, including original sources, can be found documented here:

Given the initial goal is to learn the open source frameworks, this repo leverages git submodules pointing back to the authors for now. When we begin heavily modifying code from specific sources, we can clone copies into the repo.

Many of the initial references originate from a combination of OpenRAN Gym and Northeastern University. See:
