# RAN Digital Twin Simulation

## Overview

This repository contains scripts and configurations for building a RAN (Radio Access Network) Digital Twin simulation. The simulation architecture includes a 5G core network, an RIC (RAN Intelligent Controller), disaggregated gNB (CU/DU), and multiple dedicated UE instances. The entire setup is designed to be modular, allowing customization and deployment in different modes (Core, Edge, etc.).

**This Digital Twin is designed to run over one or more VirtualBox VMs. IP override functionality will need to be leveraged if installed locally. Virtualization is strongly recommended to avoid configuration conflicts.**

### Prerequisites

- **Operating System**: Ubuntu 22.04.1

The build scripts will automatically install and configure all necessary dependencies. Ensure you are running the correct version of Ubuntu to avoid compatibility issues.

### Key Components

- **Open5GS 5GC Core**: Core Network components such as MME/AMF/SGW/PGW.
- **OSC RIC**: Modified Open Source RAN Intelligent Controller supporting machine virtualization.
- **srsRAN gNB**: Disaggregated CU/DU for the gNB.
- **srsUE**: Multiple instances of dedicated UE using srsRAN.
- **GNU Radio**: Modulation and RF signal processing for the UEs.

## Scripts

### `build-digital-twin.sh`
The primary script for building the entire RAN Digital Twin environment. This script automates the deployment of the RAN architecture, including the core network, RIC, gNB, and UE instances.

#### Usage

```bash
./build-digital-twin.sh [options]
```
### Options:

- `-mode [core|edge]`: Specify the mode of the RAN network (default: core).
- `-hostip <ip_address>`: Override the default static IP for the host machine (default: disabled).
- `-int <interface>`: Specify the network interface to configure the static IP (default: 10.0.2.15).
- `-srsP [T|F]`: Enable/Disable building the srsRAN Project package (default T).
- `-srs4G [T|F]`: Enable/Disable building the srs4G package (default: T).
- `-ue <num>`: Specify the total number of UEs to build (default: 3).
- `-ue_local <num>`: Specify the number of UEs to build on this machine (default: matches -ue).
- `-ue_idx <index>`: Specify the starting index of UEs for this machine (default: 1).

---

### `deploy-digital-twin.sh`
The deployment script for the RAN Digital Twin simulation. This script launches Open5GS, OSC RIC, srsGNB, and multiple UEs, with RF signal modulation managed through GNU Radio.

#### Usage

```bash
./deploy-digital-twin.sh [-b] <NUM_UES>
```
- `-b`: Runs the `build-digital-twin.sh` script before deploying the environment.
- `-NUM_UES`: Specify the number of UEs to deploy (required, must be a whole number).

#### Example

```bash
./deploy-digital-twin.sh -b 3
```
#### Notes:

- Make sure to run the deploy script from the project root directory.
- Use `gnome-terminal` to ensure correct tab handling for different processes.

---

### `destroy-digital-twin.sh`
This script removes all resources created by the build and deploy scripts, including Docker containers, network namespaces, and project directories.
- **Confirmation Required**: The script will prompt you for confirmation before performing the cleanup as the operation is destructive.

#### Cleaned Components:

1. **Docker Containers**: Removes all containers created by Open5GS, OSC RIC, and other components.
2. **Docker Networks**: Cleans up non-default Docker networks created during deployment.
3. **Network Namespaces**: Deletes UE namespaces (namespaces starting with ue).
4. **Project Directories**: Removes srsRAN_Project, srsRAN_4G, and oran-sc-ric directories.

---

### compile/open5gs.sh

Script to build and configure the Open5GS 5GC Core (MME/AMF/SGW/PGW).

---

### compile/osc-ric.sh

Script to build and configure the OSC RIC, supporting machine virtualization and performance monitoring.

---

### compile/srs4G.sh

Script to build and configure the srsRAN 4G package. This is needed to obtain the srsUE binary.

---

### compile/srs_project.sh

Script to build the srsRAN Project package, which includes various components such as the gNB (CU/DU).

---

### compile/srsgnb.sh

Script to build the disaggregated CU/DU for the srsRAN gNB. Also configures the gNB to connect to the E2 link on the modified RIC subnet.

---

### srsue.sh

This script generates multiple UE configuration files (`ue*_zmq.conf`) based on the number of UEs and the starting index provided as arguments. It retrieves USIM data (IMSI, Key, OP/OPc) from the `subscriber_db.csv` file and updates the configuration for each UE.
This script is automatically called during built. It can be called outside of build to generate additional UEs, but be wary that any UE not contained within the `subscriber_db.csv` file will not be able to subscribe to the network!

---

### Usage
```bash
./srsue.sh <NUM_UES> <START_INDEX>
./srsue.sh 3 1
./srsue.sh 3 3
./srsue.sh 6 3
./srsue.sh 10 1
./srsue.sh 10 10
```
Examples:
- Build 3 UEs, UE1 through UE3
- Build 3 UEs, UE4 through UE6
- Build 6 UEs, UE4 through UE9
- Build 10 UEs, UE1 through UE10
- Build 10 UEs, UE11 through UE20

---

### gnuradio.sh

This script installs gnuradio, calls `./generate_multi_ue_grc.sh <NUM_UEs>` to dynamically build modulation for the number of UEs passed in, and stages the completed `multi_ue_scenario.grc` file.

---

### generate_multi_ue_grc.sh

This script generates the config file for gnuradio modulation for a dynamic amount of passed in UEs. It leverages configurable path loss values and places UEs at even spacing across the network at launch. Once gnuradio is executed, these pathlosses can be adjusted with sliders during simulation via the gnu-companion app GUI.

---

### Usage
```bash
./generate_multi_ue_grc.sh 20
```

This will generate .grc file for 20 UEs, modulating their RF signal processing dynamically.

### Configuration Files (`configs/`)

Staged to `./srsRAN_Project/docker/open5gs` with `./open5gs.env`:
- **`subscriber_db.csv`**: Contains the subscriber information such as IMSI, Key, and OPC values. The script will ensure that values generated for each unique UE index do not overlap, even across VMs.

Staged to `./srsRAN_Project/build/apps/gnb` with `./gnb` executable:
- **`gnb_zmq.yaml`**: A template configuration file used to generate gnb configuration files. Synchronized with modified RIC configuration.

Staged to `./srsRAN_4G/build/srsue/src` with  `./srsue` executable:
- **`ue_template_zmq.conf`**: A template configuration file used to generate UE-specific configuration files, which are staged. Template not staged.

The **`srsue.sh`**: script will create individual configuration files for each UE (ueX_zmq.conf) based on this template and the data from subscriber_db.csv.

- **`multi_ue_scenario.grc`**: Configuration file for gnuradio to modulate all UEs. Start gnuradio from `./srsRAN_4G/build/srsue/src` with:

`gnuradio-companion ./multi_ue_scenario.grc`

## Build Process

1. **Clone and build**: After running the build script, the following directories will be created and populated with source files and build outputs:
   - `oran-sc-ric/`: Contains the OSC RIC build.
   - `srsRAN_4G/`: Contains the build and binaries for the srs4G UE.
   - `srsRAN_Project/`: Contains the build and binaries for the srsRAN project.

2. **Generate UEs**: `srsue.sh` script is leveraged during build to generate configuration files for the passed in number of UEs. Build automatically stages all configuration files in the appropriate directories for deployment.

3. **Run the simulation**: Once everything is built, the simulation is ready for deployment, with the RAN architecture functioning in a virtualized environment.

## Installed xApps 
### Must deploy RAN before deploying xApps

1. **KPIMon**: Monitors performance metrics at the core network via terminal CLI. To deploy from `./oran-sc-ric`:

`docker compose exec python_xapp_runner ./kpm_mon_xapp.py --metrics=DRB.UEThpDl,DRB.UEThpUl --kpm_report_style=5`

2. **Grafana**: Monitors performance metrics at the gNB via a browser window @ `localhost:3300`. To deploy from `./srsRAN_Project`:

`sudo docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yml up grafana`

---

## Future Enhancements

- Add support for edge RAN deployments: Hosting UEs from a separate VM for processing offload
- Investigate enhancements to the E2Term interface to facilitate future xApp development.
- Integration with additional xApps for enhanced performance monitoring and network optimization
