# RAN Digital Twin Simulation

## Overview

This repository contains scripts and configurations for building a RAN (Radio Access Network) Digital Twin simulation. The simulation architecture includes a 5G core network, an RIC (RAN Intelligent Controller), disaggregated gNB (CU/DU), and multiple dedicated UE instances. It also supports 4G UEs with the `srs4G` build option. The entire setup is designed to be modular, allowing customization and deployment in different modes (Core, Edge, etc.).

### Key Components

- **Open5GS 5GC Core**: Core Network components such as MME/AMF/SGW/PGW.
- **OSC RIC**: Modified Open Source RAN Intelligent Controller supporting machine virtualization.
- **srsRAN gNB**: Disaggregated CU/DU for the gNB.
- **srsUE**: Multiple instances of dedicated UE using srsRAN.
- **GNU Radio**: Modulation and RF signal processing for the UEs.

## Scripts

### `build-digital-twin.sh`
The primary script for building the entire RAN Digital Twin environment. This script automates the deployment of the RAN architecture, including the core network, RIC, gNB, and UE instances.

#### Usage

```bash
./build-digital-twin.sh [options]
