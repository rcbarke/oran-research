# RAN Digital Twin Simulation

## Overview

This repository contains scripts and configurations for building a RAN (Radio Access Network) Digital Twin simulation. The simulation architecture includes a 5G core network, an RIC (RAN Intelligent Controller), disaggregated gNB (CU/DU), and multiple dedicated UE instances. It also supports 4G UEs with the `srs4G` build option. The entire setup is designed to be modular, allowing customization and deployment in different modes (Core, Edge, etc.).

### Key Components

- **Open5GS 5GC Core**: Core Network components such as MME/AMF/SGW/PGW.
- **OSC RIC**: Modified Open Source RAN Intelligent Controller supporting machine virtualization.
- **srsRAN gNB**: Disaggregated CU/DU for the gNB.
- **srsUE**: Multiple instances of dedicated UE using srsRAN.
- **GNU Radio**: Modulation and RF signal processing for the UEs.

## Scripts

### `build-digital-twin.sh`
The primary script for building the entire RAN Digital Twin environment. This script automates the deployment of the RAN architecture, including the core network, RIC, gNB, and UE instances.

#### Usage

```bash
./build-digital-twin.sh [options]
```

### Configuration Files (`configs/`)

- **`subscriber_db.csv`**: Contains the subscriber information such as IMSI, Key, and OPC values. The script uses this file to populate each UE configuration.
- **`gnb_zmq.yaml`**: A template configuration file used to generate gnb configuration files. Synchronized with modified RIC configuration.
- **`ue_template_zmq.conf`**: A template configuration file used to generate UE-specific configuration files.

The **`srsue.sh`**: script will create individual configuration files for each UE (ueX_zmq.conf) based on this template and the data from subscriber_db.csv.

## Build Process

1. **Clone and build**: After running the scripts, the following directories will be created and populated with source files and build outputs:
   - `oran-sc-ric/`: Contains the OSC RIC build.
   - `srsRAN_4G/`: Contains the build and binaries for the srs4G UE.
   - `srsRAN_Project/`: Contains the build and binaries for the srsRAN project.

2. **Generate UEs**: Use the `srsue.sh` script to generate configuration files for the required number of UEs. The configuration files are staged in the appropriate directories.

3. **Run the simulation**: Once everything is built, the simulation is ready for deployment, with the RAN architecture functioning in a virtualized environment.

## Installed xApps 
# Must deploy RAN before deploying xApps

1. **KPIMon**: Monitors performance metrics at the core network via terminal CLI. 

2. **Grafana**: Monitors performance metrics at the gNB via a browser window @ `localhost:3300`.

## Future Enhancements

- Add `deploy-digital-twin.sh` to build the network stack in sequence across multiple VM terminals
- Enhance `build-digital-twin.sh` to prompt for a `deploy-digital-twin.sh` call, passing in all built UEs 
- Add support for edge RAN deployments: Hosting UEs from a separate VM for processing offload
- Integration with additional xApps for enhanced performance monitoring.
- Expand signal modulation and RF waveform processing using GNU Radio.
